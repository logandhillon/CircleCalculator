### Circle Calculator is a Windows Forms App written in C# that gets the radius, diameter, circumference & area of any given circle, using one of those data points.

It started as a basic script, written in a Windows Batch File, but that quickly changed when I found out the command prompt couldn't understand floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals), only integers. I re-wrote the program in Python 3.10, which is downloadable in the releases tab, and although it did what it was meant for, it wasn't the most user-friendly program ever.

## How to use Circle Calculator
Upon opening the program, input the unit of measurement, as well as the information of the circle. The program will calculate the other 3 values for you.
